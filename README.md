# OpenGL Winter Scene

This project implements a dynamic 3D winter environment using C++ and OpenGL 3.3.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Lighting:** Real-time day/night cycle with an orbiting sun and shifting color temperatures.
- **Shadow Mapping:** Directional shadows for trees and terrain using a depth framebuffer.
- **Crowd Rendering:** Efficiently renders multiple animated bots (using `tiny_gltf`) with hardware skinning support.
- **Environment Effects:** Includes a textured skybox, snowy ground, and a particle-based snow system.
- **Interactive Camera:** FPS-style movement (WASD/Arrows) and mouse-look navigation.
